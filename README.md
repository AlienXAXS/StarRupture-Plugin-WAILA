# StarRupture Plugin SDK

Everything you need to build plugins for the [StarRupture ModLoader](https://github.com/AlienXAXS/StarRupture-ModLoader) — without forking or building the modloader itself.

## What's in this repo

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `include/plugin_interface.h` | The full plugin API — interfaces, callbacks, enums |
| `include/plugin_network_helpers.h` | Typed helpers for sending and receiving network packets |
| `Waila/` | Minimal starter plugin — copy, rename, and go |
| `StarRupture SDK/` | Dumper-7 generated UE5 SDK headers (Client + Server + Generic) |
| `Shared.props` | MSBuild properties for SDK paths and build configs |
| `PluginDevelopment.md` | Full API reference and developer guide |

## Quick start

1. **Download `dwmapi.dll`** from the [latest release](../../releases/latest) — pick Client or Server depending on your target
2. **Clone this repo**
3. **Copy `Waila/` to a new folder**, rename it, and update the project name/GUID in the `.vcxproj`
4. **Add your project to `StarRupture-Plugin-SDK.sln`** (or create your own `.sln`)
5. **Build** using Visual Studio 2022 with the `Client Release` or `Server Release` configuration
6. Drop your `.dll` into `Binaries\Win64\Plugins\` alongside `dwmapi.dll` and launch the game

See [PluginDevelopment.md](PluginDevelopment.md) for the complete API reference, hook list, config system, pattern scanner, and ImGui integration.

## Build configurations

| Configuration | Target | Defines |
|---|---|---|
| `Client Debug` / `Client Release` | Game client | `MODLOADER_CLIENT_BUILD` |
| `Server Debug` / `Server Release` | Dedicated server | `MODLOADER_SERVER_BUILD` |
| `Debug` / `Release` | Generic (no SDK-specific APIs) | — |

Client builds have access to Input, UI panel, and HUD hooks. These interfaces are `nullptr` on server builds, so guard any client-only code with `#if defined(MODLOADER_CLIENT_BUILD)`.

Network channel (`hooks->Network`) is available on both client and server builds; it is `nullptr` on generic builds. Use `plugin_network_helpers.h` for typed packet send/receive rather than calling `IPluginNetworkChannel` directly.

## Runtime DLL

`dwmapi.dll` is the modloader itself. It is **not** built from this repo. Pre-built binaries are attached to each [release](../../releases/latest).

Do **not** fork or build the main modloader repo just to develop a plugin — this SDK repo is the intended starting point.

## Plugin structure (v19+)

`PluginInit` now receives a single `IPluginSelf*` instead of four separate pointers:

```cpp
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) bool PluginInit(IPluginSelf* self)
{
    g_self = self; // store — pointer is stable for the plugin's lifetime

    self->logger->Info(self, "Hello from %s", self->name);
    self->config->InitializeFromSchema(self, &MY_SCHEMA);
    self->hooks->Engine->RegisterOnInit(OnEngineInit);
    return true;
}
```

`IPluginSelf` bundles everything your plugin needs:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `const char*` | Plugin name from `PluginInfo` |
| `version` | `const char*` | Plugin version from `PluginInfo` |
| `logger` | `IPluginLogger*` | Logging interface |
| `config` | `IPluginConfig*` | Config read/write interface |
| `scanner` | `IPluginScanner*` | Memory pattern scanner |
| `hooks` | `IPluginHooks*` | All hook and event sub-interfaces |

The `Waila/` files demonstrate the full pattern.

## Interface versioning

This SDK tracks the current `PLUGIN_INTERFACE_VERSION_MAX` from the modloader. The `PluginInfo` struct your plugin returns must set `interfaceVersion` to `PLUGIN_INTERFACE_VERSION` (defined in `plugin_interface.h`) or the modloader will refuse to load it.

The SDK repo is updated alongside each modloader release.
